# AniArchive

A web application for anime/manga fans who want to find information and discover anime/manga series.

This is an application build around the Jikan API, which pulls data from MyAnimeList. This project was built to improve my skills in web development and working with XMLHttpRequest. I also have an interest in the history of anime and manga, so it was interesting for me to see how the mediums have changed over the years.
